# Graduate Admission Prediction from an Indian Perspective
## Overview
Welcome to the "Graduate Admission Prediction from an Indian Perspective" project! This repository contains Python code and Jupyter notebooks for building a machine learning model to predict the chances of admission for Indian students applying to graduate programs in universities abroad. The project aims to analyze various factors that influence admission decisions and develop an accurate predictive model.

## Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to develop a classification model that can predict whether a student will be admitted to a graduate program based on their academic and personal profiles. The dataset used for training contains information such as GRE (Graduate Record Examination) scores, TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) scores, university rankings, and other attributes. The model will learn from this labeled data to predict the admission outcome for new, unseen applicants.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises information about previous graduate applicants from India and their admission results. Each sample in the dataset includes various features, such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, Statement of Purpose (SOP) quality, Letter of Recommendation (LOR) strength, and more. The target variable is binary, indicating whether the applicant was admitted (1) or not (0).

## Goals
The main goals of this project are as follows:

Data Exploration: Perform an in-depth exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of features and the relationships between predictors and the admission decision.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and encode categorical variables as necessary for model training.
Feature Engineering: Select relevant features, create new features if needed, and identify feature importance for model performance.
Model Building: Implement classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine (SVM), to create the admission prediction model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the classification model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters to improve predictive accuracy.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the chances of admission for new applicants based on their profiles.
Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset files (if not too large) or links to the dataset source.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model implementation, and evaluation.
src/: Python scripts containing reusable functions for data processing and model implementation.
results/: Saved model, performance metrics, and visualizations.
report/: A detailed report summarizing the model's performance, feature importance, and insights.
Usage
To run the graduate admission prediction model on the provided dataset, you will need Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file:

## bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
After installing the required libraries, you can use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore the data, preprocess it, build the classification model, and evaluate its performance.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to experiment with different classification algorithms, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by the aspirations of Indian students seeking admission to graduate programs abroad. We acknowledge the contributions of researchers and educators who have worked on admission prediction and international student mobility.
